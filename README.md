## Abstract
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic autoimmune neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative disorder of the central nervous system. Pregnancy represents a natural modulation of the disease course, where patients improve, especially in the 3rd trimester, followed by a transient exacerbation after delivery. Although the exact mechanisms behind the pregnancy-induced modulation are yet to be deciphered, the immune tolerance established during pregnancy is likely involved. In this study, we used the highly sensitive and highly specific proximity extension assay technology to perform protein profiling analysis of 92 inflammation-related proteins in MS patients (n=15) and healthy controls (n=10) longitudinally sampled before, during and after pregnancy. Our findings reveal gradual dynamic changes in plasma proteins that are most prominent during the 3rd trimester, while reverting post-partum. Thus, this pattern reflects the disease activity of MS during pregnancy. Among the differentially expressed proteins in pregnancy several proteins with known immunoregulatory properties were upregulated such as PD-L1, LIF-R, TGF-β1, CCL28, and IL-10RB. On the other hand, inflammatory chemokines such as CCL23, CCL13, CCL8, and CXCL5 as well as members of the tumor necrosis factor family, TRANCE and TWEAK were downregulated. Further in-depth studies will reveal if these proteins can serve as biomarkers in MS and whether they are mechanistically involved in the disease amelioration and worsening.  A deeper understanding of the mechanisms involved, would favor new treatment strategies mimicking the pregnancy milieu.
